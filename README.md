# BMI 5331: Foundations of Pharmacogenomics
This repository is **strictly for educational purposes and serves as a backup** for my graduate school assignments related to the **BMI-5331-Foundations-of-Pharmacogenomics** course at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston.

Folder **VCF** contains a R script for analyzing **Variant Call Format (VCF)** files essential for **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**, focusing on genotype ploidy, allele phasing, and variant classification, including SNPs, indels, structural variations, and alternative alleles.

Folder **Differential_Expression_Letrozole_Responders_vs_Nonresponders** contains a R script for the analysis of gene expression between two phenotypesâ€”responders and non-responders to Letrozole drug treatment in the context of breast cancer tumors. The study leverages publicly available data from **NCBI GEO** to identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** between responders and non-responders.
