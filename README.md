# BMI-5331-Foundations-of-Pharmacogenomics
This repository is **strictly for educational purposes and serves as a backup** for my graduate school assignments related to the **BMI-5331-Foundations-of-Pharmacogenomics** course at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics at UTHealth Houston.

Folder **VCF** contains R scripts for analyzing **Variant Call Format (VCF)** files essential for **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**, focusing on genotype ploidy, allele phasing, and variant classification, including SNPs, indels, structural variations, and alternative alleles.
